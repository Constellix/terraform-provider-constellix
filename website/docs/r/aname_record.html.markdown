Manages one or more domain ANAME record.

# Example Usage #
```hcl

  domain_id   = "${constellix_domain.domain1.id}"
  ttl         = 18
  name        = "anamerecord"
  noanswer    = false
  note        = ""
  gtd_region  = 1
  type        = "ANAME"
  contact_ids = [123]
  source_type = "domains"
  roundrobin {
    value        = "www.whatsapp.com."
    disable_flag = false
  }
  roundrobin {
    value        = "www.info.com."
    disable_flag = false
  }
  record_option = "failover"
  record_failover_values {

## Importing ##

An existing Record can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource using its Id, via the following command:
[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html


```
terraform import constellix_aname_record.example <source>:<parent-id>:<record-id>
```

Where source can be either domains or templates; parent-id is domain-id or template-id based on the source provided and record-id is the Id of record calculated via Constellix API.
