  type        = "CERT"
  gtd_region  = 1
  note        = "First record"
  noanswer    = false
  roundrobin {

## Attributes Reference
The only attribute that this resource exports is the `id`, which is set to the constellix calculated id of the CERT resource.

## Importing ##

An existing Record can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource using its Id, via the following command:
[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html


```
terraform import constellix_cert_record.example <source>:<parent-id>:<record-id>
```

Where source can be either domains or templates; parent-id is domain-id or template-id based on the source provided and record-id is the Id of record calculated via Constellix API.
